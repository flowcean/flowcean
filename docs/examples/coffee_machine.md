# Coffee Machine Example

This example shows how to train a model to predict the behavior of an automaton.
Inspired by the work of Steffen et al.[^1], we consider a simple coffee machine.
LearnLib[^2], a framework for automata learning written in Java, is used for the inference of the automaton.

## Run this example

### Docker Container

The external learner written in Java is containerized for this example.
Thus, Docker must be installed to run it.
Follow the instructions on the [official Docker page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install it.
The image for this example is stored in the GitHub container registry.
Authentication is required for this.
Log in to the registry by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/de/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authentifizieren-bei-der-container-registry).
Afterwards run the `run.py` for this example.

The required images will be automatically retrieved, and a container will be started.

## Local Execution

It is also possible to directly run the Java server locally.
**Before** running the example in Flowcean, the server-side has to be started manually by running the Java-project in *java/AutomataLearner*.
A JDK and the Maven build automaton tool are required.
More information on Maven projects using the LearnLib library can be found on [their website](https://learnlib.de/).
It has to be assured that the *ip* and *port* match those of the server configuration in Java.
