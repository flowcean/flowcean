# Welcome to Flowcean

**Flowcean** is an advanced, versatile framework designed to streamline the automatic generation of models for cyber-physical systems (CPS).
Whether you are developing solutions for smart grids, autonomous vehicles, or industrial automation, Flowcean provides a higher-level abstraction to generalize the learning and modeling approach for CPS across various domains.


## What is Flowcean?

Flowcean is engineered to simplify and accelerate the process of creating, deploying, and managing models for cyber-physical systems.
Here’s what Flowcean can do:

- **Automatic Model Generation**: Flowcean automates the creation of models tailored to cyber-physical systems, allowing you to focus on refining performance rather than starting from scratch.
- **Domain-Agnostic Flexibility**: Generate models for diverse domains, whether you’re working offline, incrementally, or through active learning approaches.
- **Custom Data Environments**: Integrate your project-specific data sources seamlessly, enabling personalized modeling.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Evaluate your models with standard metrics or extend the framework to include your own custom evaluation.
- **Python-Based with gRPC Interface**: Flowcean is written in Python and allows easy connection to any learning algorithm via a gRPC interface, providing flexibility and compatibility with your existing toolchains.

## Why Flowcean?

Flowcean stands out as the go-to framework for cyber-physical system modeling for several reasons:

- **Unified Framework**: Manage every aspect of CPS modeling under one roof, reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend Flowcean across various learning strategies, whether you're working with traditional machine learning methods or cutting-edge techniques.
- **Modular and Customizable Pipelines**: Compose and customize machine learning pipelines from a modular toolbox, tailoring solutions to your specific needs.
- **Reusable Models**: Save and reuse your models for future predictions, enhancing productivity and consistency across projects.
