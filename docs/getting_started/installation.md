# Installation

It is recommended to use `flowcean` in a virtual environment.
Consult [Preparation](preparation.md) or the official [python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for further information.

Install the flowcean package:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

For the full functioning experience, flowcean splits its features into optional dependency packages.
Have a look at `pyproject.toml` and respectively install additional dependency groups.
