# Research Project: AGenC

The AGenC project aims to shorten development cycles in the design of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and make their operation safer and more efficient.

CPS are becoming increasingly important.
They dominate almost all IT application fields, from mobility, logistics, and mechanical engineering to energy technology.
Examples of CPS include measuring devices, sorting machines, and robots.
These are networked computer systems (*cyber*) that interact directly with the environment (*physical*) through sensors and actuators, following the logic of input, computation, and output.

The goal of the AGenC project is to create a toolkit with standardized methods and interoperable technology solutions for modeling CPS across various application areas.
AGenC stands for *A*utomatic *Gen*eration of Models for Prediction, Testing, and Monitoring of *C*yber-Physical Systems.

This work is funded by BMBF project AGenC no. 01IS22047A.
