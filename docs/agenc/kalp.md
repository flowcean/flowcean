# KALP GmbH

KALP GmbH is an innovative company based in Böel, Schleswig-Holstein, specializing in container terminal equipment.
With its product, the Automatic Lashing Platform (ALP), the company automates the final manual steps in global container terminal operations.
During the lashing process, twistlocks — locking elements used to secure containers stacked on a ship's deck — are either inserted (loading) or removed (unloading).
The ALP performs this task fully automatically and independently, enhancing both quay safety and terminal productivity.
For the AGenC project, KALP GmbH is providing its ALP for required pressure measurements and is supporting the initiative with its extensive expertise, particularly in the field of hydraulic applications.
