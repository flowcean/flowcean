# Use Case

The three main use cases in the AGenC research project will be described in the following sections.

## Data-Driven Monitoring for Autonomous Mobile Robots

Mobile robots and autonomous vehicles are key technological developments in logistics that can significantly improve the efficiency, cost reduction and flexibility of production and logistics processes.
The autonomous navigation of these vehicles depends largely on reliable localization systems.
Various environmental influences such as uneven ground, dust, direct sunlight or extreme weather conditions can disrupt localization systems and jeopardize process reliability.

Data-driven monitoring software is to be developed and evaluated using Flowcean in order to detect and monitor these faults.
The aim is to control the localization quality during operation, identify errors and make adjustments to ensure the safety and efficiency of the robots.
This includes the collection of relevant environmental data, the creation of models to estimate the uncertainty of the robot pose and the use of synthetic and real sensor data for modeling.
The models are validated experimentally to ensure their transferability to real application scenarios.

## Energy Optimization and Container Weight Estimation
