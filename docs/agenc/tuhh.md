## Institute of Logistics Engineering (ITL)

The Institute of Logistics Engineering (ITL) is characterized by close networking with numerous industrial partners. Since its foundation in 2016, the ITL has been dedicated to the research and application of localization systems due to their enormous potential for logistics processes. A test stand was put into operation on the ITL test area, which enables the high-precision, automated evaluation of localization systems with regard to various quality characteristics. In addition, a methodology for the experimental testing and evaluation of localization systems has been developed. The ITL is also working on the use of machine learning algorithms in intralogistics, in particular the development of practical tools for testing, monitoring and predicting technical systems in the areas of conveying and order picking. In the project, ITL will contribute its expertise and the test bench for data generation for learning localization system behavior.

ITL's focus in the project is on the generation of empirical data and the development of monitoring and testing tools for the design and operation of cyber-physical systems. The aim is to apply these tools in logistics systems, e.g. to predict the technical performance of robot localization systems and monitor them during operation. To generate data, the ITL will provide and expand a test stand for the evaluation of robot localization systems. The partners SICK and STILL will contribute data, hardware, expertise and logistical use cases in the field of localization and robotics in order to demonstrate the added value of the AGenC framework using real practical examples.
