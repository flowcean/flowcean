# Fraunhofer CML

The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, based in Germany, is the world's leading organization for applied research.
The Fraunhofer-Center for Maritime Logistics and Services CML focuses on prediction, simulation and optimization for the maritime transport and port industry.
CML's Port Technologies group focuses on port technology systems and research topics related to the automation of processes in the port environment.

As part of the project, the Fraunhofer CML is contributing its expertise in complex port technology systems, their modeling and integration into existing and newly developed software frameworks.
For this project, the automatic lashing platform (ALP), which is being developed by project partner KALP GmbH, is being investigated and analyzed.
First, a numerical model of this platform is created in order to be able to generate independent synthetic data.
In parallel, real measurement data is recorded from the platform in operation at a port terminal.
Based on both data sources, a reliable model of the ALP is generated with the help of the Flowcean framework.
The aim is to integrate this model into operations in order to improve the productivity, reliability and safety of the port technology system.
