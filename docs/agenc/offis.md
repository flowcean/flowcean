# OFFIS e.V. -- Institute for Information Technology

As an affiliated institute of the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, the Oldenburg Research and Development Institute for Information Technology (OFFIS) has been converting scientific know-how from information technology into solutions that can then be further developed into marketable products by business partners since it was founded in 1991. Around 300 employees work on numerous computer science projects, almost always with a direct application focus.

OFFIS has many years of research expertise in the fields of AI and distributed AI. In the [Smart Nord](https://smartnord.de/) research network, e.g., a fully distributed, agent-based system was designed that developed new approaches in terms of system stability. In the [FRESH](https://www.offis.de/offis/projekt/fresh.html) research project, OFFIS is using agent technology to provide control power using battery electric vehicles at the Altenwerder container terminal. As part of the BMBF-funded research project [PYRATE](https://www.offis.de/offis/projekt/pyrate.html), OFFIS is demonstrating the cross-domain analysis of cyber-physical systems and has already presented approaches for the analysis of weak points in energy markets. The [palaestrAI](https://docs.palaestr.ai/) software tool developed as part of PYRATE is to be used in AGenC as a tool for test case generation and extended for monitoring.
