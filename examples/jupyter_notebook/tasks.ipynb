        "This is a tutorial file for interactively showing how to use flowcean. In this Jupyter notebook, you will go through the steps of training machine learning models using the [`flowcean`](https://flowcean.me/) framework. If you want to code along, use this notebook and see the solutions underneath each task. We also provide [all the solutions combined in one notebook](solutions.ipynb).\n",

        "This example is created using the package [turtlesim](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim), a tool designed for teaching the Robot Operating System (ROS). The example trains models to predict the next pose of the turtle, $\\textbf{x}_{k+1}$, based on the current pose $\\textbf{x}_{k}$ and velocity commands $\\textbf{u}_{k}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "ROS uses _topics_ to communicate between _nodes_. Nodes are processes that perform computations. They can **subscribe** to topics (receive messages from other nodes) or **publish** on topics (send messages to other nodes). In this example, the velocity commands are published to the `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic by the turtle's teleop node (a node that lets you control the turtle interactively). The turtlesim node receives these velocity commands by subscribing to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` and publishes the turtle's pose to `/turtle1/pose`.\n",
