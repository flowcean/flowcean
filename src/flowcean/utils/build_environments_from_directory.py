    This helper function can be used to build environments from multiple files
    or folders. First all files and folders in the `path` matching the
    `pattern` are selected. These are then passed to the `builder` function
    which creates the environment.

    Args:
        path: The path to the directory from which environments are created.
        builder: A function building an environment from a path and returning
            it.
        pattern: A glob pattern. Matching files and folders will be passed to
            `builder`.
        include_files: Specify whether to pass files to `builder`.
        include_folders: Specify whether to pass folders to `builder`.
